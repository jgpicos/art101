				Jason - My biggest problem here was having to reuse my old
				JavaScript functions from Lab7, and reworking
				CaseInsensitiveSort() to accept a string instead of an array.
				Then inside that I split the string, sorted it, and then
				recombined it all in the same line (technically). My next hard
				part was getting the output to look fancy, but that was easy with
				.innerHTML.

				Jesus - The heading was still the most difficult part of the html
				and css aspects. Once I was able to make all the words stay on the
				same line I tried to make the heading “fixed” which stactter the words
				far beyond the div constraints. After forcing them all back into their
				rightful div I chose a nice color palette and encased all the H2s in
				soft rounded rectangles to spice the page up. Without the hr underneath
				them the text below was too close to the h2 but i figured out that by
				increasing the line height and the margin-bottom I could negate that.

			<p>This design is based off of our last lab's failed design. This
				time we got the heading to show up properly with the words on
				opposite sides as well as having it stay at the top of the screen
				as you scroll!
