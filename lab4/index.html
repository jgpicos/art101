			<p id = "main_subtitle">
					While working on this lab one of the biggest issues we faced <br>
					was the wording of the lab. We were confused if the lab wanted <br>
					the pseudocode as an undorded list in our html file or merely <br>
					as an image. Other than that this lab was straight forward.
