The Vaquita is the smallest porpoise and their name means "little cow."
They inhabit the Gulf of California where they frequently fall victim to
illegal fishing operations. On the brink of total extinction, they are the
most endangered marine animal in the world.
(*Note: Colors not actual. Vaquitas are usually various shades of grey.)
