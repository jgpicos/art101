				Jason - The hardest part for me was figuring out why CORS was throwing
				a fit. Brock linked this really good article on WHY CORS exists (which
				makes me want to rethink my own web request stuff) and how to bypass
				it. Once we figured that out this lab was pretty easy to get going.
				We’re getting really really comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
				P.s. jQuery and I went on a date (I think she’s the one)
				<br><br>
				Jesus - Not many notable issues to report this time. Aside from setting
				up the bare bones of the js file and forgetting what the alt was for a
				bit everything went smoothly.
