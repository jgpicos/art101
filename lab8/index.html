          <h2>Problems</h2>
			          <p>
			            Some of the problems we ran into include a small problem we
									ran into was just teletype stopping Jesus from editing code
									until we reset.Next we also had to troubleshoot printing
									our JS output onto the web page as well as being in the
									console. Part of this process was Jason trying to figure out 
									how to NOT overwrite an entire page of HTML and CSS beauty
									with the document.writeln() thing was a headache. We gave up
									a little and went to StackOverflow to find anything that
									would help. EVentually, we found the innerHTML property that
									helped us a lot. (Perhaps there is an outerHTML property?
									Dun dun dun...)

            <h2>Teletype Issuses</h2>
            <p>
      				Teletype would not allow Jesus to edit cetain code randomly
							unless we stopped sharing and started again.
            </p>
            <h2>Side Note</h2>
						<p>This its the entended layout of our last lab. After failing to
						recreate it last time, I found out how to do it using a new method
						that is more reliable!</p>
