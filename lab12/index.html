				Jason - I was completely oblivious to the fact (once again) that
				JavaScript uses brackets, not curly braces for arrays. I spent
				probably 10 more minutes than I should have working on trying to
				figure out why it was throwing a fit over it not being able to
				access my array of Hogwarts houses. I originally had a big if()
				else if() else if() etc block for handling those cases but I
				eventually changed that to just working with an array after
				applying the modulus. I also forgot that charAt() is a FUNCTION…
				not an accessor. I kept trying to do str.charAt[i], not
				str.charAt(i) which threw a bunch of errors.

				Jesus - First of all the audacity “Position: Absolute” has is
				tremendous. I had to fiddle around for so long to make a semi
				decent looking top hat (I would have tried to recreate the sorting
				hat using css and HTML but I value my sanity). In order to place
				my divs so that they would resemble a hat, I tried position fixed
				but the divs just followed as i Scrolled so I looked it up and I
				needed absolute. After painstakingly fixing it into place everything
				else was a breeze.
