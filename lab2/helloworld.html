		<p>Hey I'm Jesus. I'm a third year AGPM student. Though I've taken coding
			 classes before I haven't actually coded a website until this class. I love
			  graphic design so making a web page is something I've been meaning to do
				for a long time!</p>
		<p>Hello I am Jacob! This is my first year at UCSC. Before now I have never
			taken an art class. This should be a fun way to combine two of my intrests!
		 	Outside of school, I love playing soccer and vidogames with my friends. </p>
