				Since all of our labs have been near perfect, we decided
				for this lab to just mess with the debugger tool in the
				browser window for the for-loops we used in a couple of the
				previous labs. The coolest thing was it showed us what
				iteration we were on when the code paused, and it also
				allows you to continue on even after it’s paused.

			In this screenshot, you can see how I created a pause
			on the else statement in the code. That else is only
			run if the i’th number cannot be divided by any of the
			four options. Using the debugger tool (and a lot of
			clicking) we can find out which numbers can’t be divided.
			It also adds comments for each line telling us EXACTLY
			 what is equal to what. This is really neat because we
			 know a couple languages and haven’t even bothered to
			 use this feature.

			In this shot in Firefox from Lab 11 I put a pause/break on the
			Challenge button for when you click on it, this is actually kind
			of cool because this is a good way of figuring out if you have
			actually clicked the button before the whole script proceeds on.
